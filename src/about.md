### A Little About Me

I've been interested in all things hardware and software my entire life. I believe that software exists to make life easier for humans.
I strive to write software that does just that; while making sure that it is well-written, performant, and readable.

I have a knack for picking thing up quickly and a need to always be learning. Which has helped me accumulate a large base of knowledge 
across the software stack. Allowing me to function as an effective and efficient full stack developer.

Building programs that save time and energy or have a meaningful impact on someone else's life are what I hope to create.
