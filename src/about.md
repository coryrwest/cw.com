### What I am looking for now

My deepest motivation is to build software that save time and energy or has a meaningful impact on someone else's life.

I am currently most interested in recent work around LLM's, massaging insights out of big data, or any company that is working to solve the coming climate crisis.

If you found your self here and meet one those criteria, I really want to talk to you.
