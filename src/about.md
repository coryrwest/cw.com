### A Little About Me

I have lived in California most of my life and love it. I love computers and have been tinkering with them my whole life. I am a jack of all trades when it comes to computers.

I am conscious of the environment and our impact on it. I love building programs that save me time and energy or have a meaningful impact on someone else's life.
